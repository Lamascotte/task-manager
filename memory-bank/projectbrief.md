- **User Role:** Personal task tracking with client/project association
- **Admin Role:** Complete oversight with intelligent dashboard and analytics

### 2. Admin Dashboard Intelligence
- **Core Need:** Admin must see ALL tasks from ALL users with flexible exploration
- **Key Requirement:** "Dashboard with stats" + "flexibility to find information easily"
- **Expected Outcome:** Beautiful, easy-to-use interface with comprehensive data access

### 3. Mobile-First Responsive Design
- **Primary Target:** Smartphone optimization
- **Secondary:** Tablet and desktop enhancement
- **Design Philosophy:** Modern, clean, intuitive navigation

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
✅ **Authentication System** (admin/user roles)  
✅ **Client & Project Management** (admin CRUD)  
✅ **Task Management** (user creation, admin oversight)  
✅ **Intelligent Dashboard** (analytics, filters, search)  
✅ **Responsive Interface** (mobile-first design)  
✅ **Data Persistence** (localStorage with demo data)

### Out of Scope (Future Evolution)
❌ Backend/Server implementation  
❌ Multi-user concurrent access  
❌ Real-time collaboration  
❌ Data export functionality  
❌ User registration system

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **Admin can view ALL user tasks** with complete details (user, client, project, date)
2. **Flexible data exploration** via search, filters, and drill-down navigation
3. **Complete client/project management** with CRUD operations
4. **Real-time statistics** updating as data changes
5. **Responsive interface** working seamlessly on all device sizes

### Quality Requirements
1. **Clean, maintainable code** following SOLID principles
2. **Modular architecture** enabling easy feature extension
3. **Comprehensive documentation** for future development
4. **Security considerations** (XSS protection, input validation)
5. **Performance optimization** for smooth user experience

## Key Constraints

### Technical
- **No external dependencies** (pure vanilla JavaScript)
- **Browser compatibility** (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- **Client-side only** (no server required)
- **File size optimization** (minimal load times)

### User Experience
- **Intuitive navigation** (no learning curve)
- **Immediate feedback** (notifications, loading states)
- **Consistent design language** (cohesive visual system)
- **Accessibility standards** (keyboard navigation, contrast)

## Definition of Done

### MVP Completion Criteria
1. **Authentication working** with predefined admin/user accounts
2. **Admin dashboard operational** with all core analytics
3. **Task management functional** for both roles
4. **Client/project CRUD complete** with proper validation
5. **Responsive design verified** across target devices
6. **Documentation complete** for handoff and maintenance

### Quality Gates
- **Zero JavaScript errors** in browser console
- **All features tested** manually across roles
- **Code reviewed** for maintainability and patterns
- **Documentation validated** for completeness and accuracy
