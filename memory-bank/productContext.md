# Product Context - Daily Task Logger

## Why This Project Exists

### Business Problem
Organizations and freelancers need a simple way to track daily work activities with clear client/project categorization. Traditional tools are either too complex (enterprise solutions) or too simple (basic to-do lists), missing the sweet spot of organized professional task tracking.

### Target Users
